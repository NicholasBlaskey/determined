**Improvements**

-  Security: Setting ``registry_auth.serveraddress`` will now only send credentials to the server
   configured. Not setting ``registry_auth`` is now deprecated and will be required soon.

-  Agent: Users may now run ``docker login`` on agent host machines to authenticate with Docker
   registries. Note if an agent is running inside a Docker container then ``~/.docker/config.json``
   will need to be mounted to the same path inside the container.
